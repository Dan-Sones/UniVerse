# UniVerse

This Repository contains the code for my Distributed Systems Assignment Implementation (Scoring 80%). It combines a number of technologies in order to produce a fully deployable AWS architecture allowing for reliable and scalable delivery of messages.

The frontend is written using React and the backend is written using Golang.

Flink is written using Java, with the project based on the provided example Flink Application Structure available [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.flink/flink-quickstart-java).
